# Pokémon Crystal

I strongly advise not to use this repo, as the code is messy, and very outdated. Though the music player and voltorb flip may be the only worthwile things here.

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.

The source code in this project successfully converts back into a ROM image.

The following rom is used as a base:

	Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc
	md5: 9f2922b235a5eeb78d65594e82ef5dde

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
